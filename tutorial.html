                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp2">My arm twitched with the need to reach out for Sam’s hand for comfort, but she was soundly sleeping on the other side of the back seat. I didn’t know how she’d managed to nap again in the car after already sleeping through the entire twelve hours flight. I was a tad jealous actually. The jet lag affected me as well, but I was too worked up to rest.</p>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp3">I looked out of the side window at the grey sky and the white landscape that had been covered in fresh snow. With the snowfall having died down, it seemed like we were the only thing moving amidst the frozen countryside. It was a peaceful scenery. A cold and peaceful scenery.</p>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp4">"Why is there a swimsuit in my bag?" I murmured and ran a sleeve over the breath-clouded window. Sam’s snoring stopped. Her leather jacket rustled as she stirred.</p>
                                    <a class="tr__polaroid__link slideInUp slideInUp5" href="#" data-featherlight="img/story/lara_landscape.jpg">
                                        <div class="tr__polaroid left"><img src="img/story/lara_landscape_pola.jpg" class="img-responsive"></div>
                                    </a>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">"Jacuzzi," she groaned dozily like a zombie. Her eyes were still closed.</p>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">"Right." I didn't see the appeal yet in going for a bath in the freezing cold. Sam slapped my leg.</p>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">"Right," she imitated (aped?) me, which came out more as a long yawn. "You’ll see." She pulled her open jacket close, wrapped her arms around herself, and rolled over to find a position in which she could sleep on.</p>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">I looked at her with raised brows and felt a cold chill run over my skin. Against my protests, the short leather jacket was all she’d put on over her jumper. I probably looked like the marshmallow man next to her, but at least I’d been comfortably warm when we’d left the plane—unlike her. It was actually colder in Japan than back in London. Fortunately, the car Sam’s parents had sent to pick us up was heated.</p>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">"You should’ve dressed more warmly." When Sam only scoffed, I added, "Or do you want your mother to tend to you while you’re ill in bed?" Sam’s exaggerated, disgusted face made me chuckle.</p>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">"I’ll be fine. You can keep me warm though if you’re worried." While she gave me a tired but persistent smirk, I gave the driver a worried glance. "Just some friendly cuddling," she added. "It was a stupid idea not to sit together."</p>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">"It was your idea," I reminded her.</p>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">"Well, in theory it was a good one." She grinned half-heartedly before pointing at the front seat with a shrug. "He’s just the driver. And when we arrive, we’ll just sit apart again. Seriously, we’re going to spend an entire week with my parents. I really need some good cuddles now."</p>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">Sighing, I turned to her with a resigned smile. With swift movements belying her tired look, Sam opened her seat belt and re-belted up in the middle of the back seat. She snuggled into me as we locked arms. I preferred it that way as well. Sam made me feel a kind of warmth the car heater couldn’t provide. I relaxed into her until Sam’s smug smirk caught my attention.</p>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">"What?"</p>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">"Loved the stupid grin you just had," she chuckled, now sporting one herself. My eyes were still rolling at her, when her face fell and she put her head back on my shoulder. "I really wanna kiss you right now," she muttered.</p>
                                    <a class="tr__polaroid__link slideInUp slideInUp5" href="#" data-featherlight="img/story/carsnuggle.jpg">
                                        <div class="tr__polaroid right"><img src="img/story/carsnuggle_pola.jpg" class="img-responsive"></div>
                                    </a>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">"<i>You</i> said it’s better if your parents don’t know yet that we’re..."</p>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">"I know, I know," she sighed. "It is for the better. They’ll take you apart and then put you through the meat grinder if I tell them you’re my girlfriend. The words girlfriend and boyfriend instantly raise red flags for them. I mean, I don’t blame them, I guess. Had I been my daughter, I would’ve kicked me out way sooner than they did."</p>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">"You were young and daft," I said jokingly and gave her a squeeze. Snorting, she slapped my leg again.</p>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">"And now… I’m just older." She pulled a disgusted face. I had to chuckle but also admit I was proud of her that she was able to reflect on herself like that. To say her youth had been wild would be far from an exaggeration, but she’d grown quite a lot in the three years since we’d first met—as a person and on me.</p>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">Sam was smiling at me again. "So, considering how much we’ll have to hold back in the next days, we really should we make out now." Her smile had turned into a grin. "Just ignore the driver," she said and leant in wanting to give me a kiss.</p>
                                    <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">Hesitating for a moment, I held her back and glanced at the front seats again.</p>

                                <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp2">"Sam, no."</p>
                                <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp3">"Sam, yes."</p>
                                <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp4">....</p>
                                <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp2">"Anyway," she continued, "we really have to make my parents like you before we let them know about us. So, behave yourself!” She gave me an intense look and waved her finger at me. I scoffed, to which Sam poked my well-padded shoulder. "I’m serious. Like—"</p>
                                <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp3">"I always behave myself." My head heated up a tad from Sam’s accusing tone. I was short of adding ‘unlike you’.</p>
                                <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp4">"Like—don’t interrupt anyone." Sam’s smug look made me sigh. Slumping, I mentally braced myself for what I knew I was in for now that I’d accidentally proven her point.  "Especially not my mom," she begun. "But neither Dad, really. And, no," she rose her finger at me again, "that doesn’t mean you get to keep quiet. Make conversation. Show some interest. Mom’s a sucker for compliments, but don’t overdo it, or I’ll throw up." Sam paused to shudder. "Ask questions. Dad has all this old stuff standing around. Maybe you can whip out your archeological super powers and you can bond over that and become best buddies. But don’t. Break. Anything." Sam had put on her serious face for that. Rolling my eyes, I turned to look out the window with warm cheeks.</p>
                                <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">"Are you listening?"</p>
                                <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">"Yeah, yeah."</p>
                                <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">"Lara…" Sam waited until I looked at her again. "This is important. It’s important to me."</p>
                                <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">"I know," I sighed.</p>
                                <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">"I want them to take you serious. To take us serious. This is on me that we have to deal with this but, please, just help me here." She gave me a pleading look that made me wanting to tell her that it wasn’t going to be the end of everything should it go south, but I had my own reasons why that week with her parents was important.</p>
                                <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">Seemingly placated, Sam put her head back on my shoulder.</p>
                                <p class="tr__para slideInUp slideInUp5">...................</p>
